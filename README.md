# OwnCdn
The purpose of this project is to build up an internal CDN for networks, where
developers can't access the internet directly (nor can the users).

It consists of a server (coming soon) and a tiny frontend.

## Frontend
The purpose of the frontend is to list all downloaded scripts and give the
developer a copy-to-clipboard (clipbard.js) that can be used to paste the
script link directly into your code.
